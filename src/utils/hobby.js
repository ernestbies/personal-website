As a young boy, I ran my own servers in online games that were very popular all over the country (in games such as Minecraft and GTA). It was the first time I encountered the Java programming language. Currently, I am interested in programming mobile and internet applications. I try to create applications with an attractive and user-friendly interface. I deepen my knowledge in the field of programming, relational and non-relational databases, operation and design of web applications, as well as application security.',

These things are not foreign to me. I competed with the best players from around the world in games such as Counter Strike, H1Z1, Apex Legends and VALORANT. E-sport has taught me the desire for continuous development, teamwork, which is a key element of every e-sport game, and drawing conclusions. During the online games, I also had the opportunity to meet many people from around the world with whom I have very good contact on a daily basis.',

        text: 'I have been interested in the world of cinema since childhood. In my opinion, watching movies is a chance to get to know many cultures and customs from around the world. Watching movies allows you to develop your imagination and the desire to get to know the world. I mainly like watching action movies, dramas and thrillers. Mind-blowing psychological thrillers are my favorites. While watching, the viewer must focus on the plot, think and try to find a solution to a specific puzzle. My favorite movies of this type are Prisoners, The Game, Inception and Split. Sometimes I also like to laugh, have fun and watch a good comedy! :-)',
